DEA(Data Envelopment Analysis) is a non-parametric method used to measure the efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) like businesses, hospitals, or schools. It compares multiple entities with similar inputs and outputs to identify best practices and inefficiencies.
Key Concepts of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis):
1. Purpose:
◦ Evaluates the relative efficiency of organizations (DMUs) that use similar inputs to produce outputs.
◦ Helps answer: "Which units are performing optimally, and which are not?"
2. How It Works:
◦ Uses linear programming to create an "efficiency frontier" (best-performing DMUs).
◦ Inefficient units are measured by their distance from this frontier.
3. Inputs vs. Outputs:
◦ Inputs: Resources used.
◦ Outputs: Results achieved.
